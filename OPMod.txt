- Configured mod.config (by hand, ofc)
- Soft link my forked engine as ./engine
- Have the engine compiled.
- Removed OpenRA.Mods.Example
- Soft link common, ra and yupgi_alert into ./mods
- Make sure that in mod.config, MOD_ID == yupgi_alert !
- launch-game.cmd runs my mod OK.
- Erm... I can't do packaging on Windows haha
  https://github.com/OpenRA/OpenRAModSDK says:

- Fortunately I have Babun (friendly Cygwin)
- ARGH dos2unix all .sh scripts in packaging
- dos2unix mod.config
- FAILED.

- Take 2, on a Linux box.
- Make the engine, manually.
- Soft link the engine as ./engine
- Can't launch the game on a Linux box remotely but oh well... Skip this one.
- Now for packaging.
- $ bash packaging/package-all.sh r015 tmp
- I don't have makensis so... installing.
  yaourt -S nsis2
- Now I get:
error CS7064: Error opening icon file `yupgi_alert.ico'. Could not find file "/home/jdj/mod/O
penRAModSDK/packaging/windows/yupgi_alert.ico".
- Time to make an icon for my mod :)
  Added icon.png. Generated icon.ico from it.
- Seems to run fine now.
- You need to provide ico
- Put mods/yupgi_alert as a real folder, not soft link.
- packaging/package-all.sh : the parameter, outputdir must be ABSOLUTE.
